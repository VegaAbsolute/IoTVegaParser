## Device description
<img src="https://iotvega.com/content/ru/ts11/ava2.jpg" width="400" />

LoRaWAN® network tester. The device is able to work in a standalone mode for several hours due to built-in battery. TS-12 sends a special signal to the LoRaWAN® network, in response to which the network informs it about the number of gateways that have received this signal and the signal quality. This data tester displays every time you press the button.
The network tester Vega TS-12 has the function of determining the coordinates by the satellites. When this feature is enabled, the tester continuously updates its coordinates and sends them with the standard packet to the LoRaWAN® network.
The device can be used to test networks of the standard LoRaWAN® when they are deployed and configured. The tester helps to decide on the best placement of gateways and terminals relative to each other.


## Description of data fields

Packet from network tester sent on port 4 and contains the following fields:
- `batteryVoltage` - battery voltage (mV), data type `Number`;
- `decoder` - name and version of the decoder, data type `String`;
- `downlinksCount` - downlinks packets counter, data type `Number`;
- `latitude` - latitude, data type `String`;
- `longitude` - longitude, data type `String`;
- `presence` - data presence, data type `Object`, contains the following fields:
    - `battery` - battery charge information (**true** - if present in packet, **false** - if not present in packet), data type `Boolean`;
    - `countsDownlinks` - downlinks packets counter (**true** - if present in packet, **false** - if not present in packet), data type `Boolean`;
    - `countsUplinks` - uplinks packets counter (**true** - if present in packet, **false** - if not present in packet), data type `Boolean`;
    - `navigation` - navigation data (**true** - if present in packet, **false** - if not present in packet), data type `Boolean`;
    - `reason` - sending reason (**automatically** - automatically, **byButtonTriggering** - by button triggering), data type `String`;
    - `RSSIAndSNR` - information about RSSI and SNR (**true** - if present in packet, **false** - if not present in packet), data type `Boolean`;
